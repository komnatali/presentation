					<h2>What is NLP?</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>TO BE BRIEF, it is a technology used to aid computers to understand the human’s natural language and process it, to get computers closer to a human-level understanding of language.</p>

					<section> <h2>History</h2> </section>
					<section>
						<p>1950 - Alan Turing test</p>
						<img src="./assets/imgs/alan.jpg" alt="Alan Turing Test">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The history of NLP started in  1950s, when Alan Turing published an article titled "Intelligence" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.</p>
							<p>It is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.</p>
							<p>During the 1960-1970 some successful NLP systems were developed. It’s time for random facts about them: </p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>1966 - ELIZA</p>
						<img src="./assets/imgs/eliza.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">Its most famous script was DOCTOR, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. The program had only to reflect back the patient's statements and ask non-directional questions.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>1970 - SHRDLU (ETAOIN SHRDLU) </p>
						<aside class = "notes">The name of this system consists 6 of 12 most frequently used letters.</aside>

						<p>Chatterbots</p>
						<p class="fragment">1980s - revolution! Machine learning algorithms!</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> Programmers began to write programs which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data (many chatterbots were written); </p>
							<p> Up to the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. And there was a REVOLUTION in this area when machine learning algorithms for language processing were introduced. </p>

						<h3>Spell checking</h3>
						<aside class = "notes">
							<p>How does it work?</p>

						<h3>keyword searching</h3>
						<img src="./assets/imgs/keyword.jpg" alt="Keyword searcging">
						<aside class = "notes">
							We use it when we want to find a proper information and article for our PRESENTATION task. Also it helps to categorize the article into the relevant subject.

						<h3>information extraction</h3>
						<p>
							<span class = "bold">Example:</span>
							<span> <span class="fragment grow highlight-green">PERSON</span> works for <span class="fragment grow highlight-current-blue">ORGANIZATION</span> </span>
						</p>
						<aside class = "notes">
							<p>Information extraction (from any text, document or website)</p>
							<p>For example, we can extract relashionship between a person and organization. We have a sentence PERSON works for ORGANIZATION and understand everything.</p>

							<h3>What are the techniques used in NLP?</h3>
							<p>Two main techniques are used: syntactic analysis and semantic analysis.</p>
							<p>The 1st is used for understanding how the natural language aligns with the grammatical rules. </p>
							<p>The 2nd is used to understand the meaning and interpretation of words and how sentences are structured.</p>

						<h3>Syntax techniques</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Tokenization</h3>
						<p> Breaking up a text into smaller pieces </p>
						<aside class = "notes">
							It is the act of breaking up a text into pieces such as phrases, words, symbols and other elements, which are called tokens.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Lemmatization</h3>
						<p> Reducing inflected forms of a word into a single form (lemma)</p>
						<p class = "bold fragment">Examples:</p>
						<p class = "fragment"> better &rarr; good </p>
						<p class = "fragment"> go, gone, going &rarr; go </p>
						<aside class = "notes">
							<p> It’s a process of reducing the various inflected forms of a word into a single form (which is called lemma). It’s used for easier analysis. </p>
							<p> To use this technique  it is necessary to have detailed dictionaries which the algorithm can look through to link the form back to its lemma. </p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Stemming</h3>
						<p>Reducing the inflected words to their root form</p>
						<aside class = "notes">
							<p> It is the process of reducing the inflected words to their root form. Developing a stemmer is far simpler than building a lemmatizer.</p>
							<p>If we compare this technique with the previous one, we understnd that is's much easier to develop a stemmer than build a lemmatizer.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Morphological segmentation</h3>
						<img src="./assets/imgs/morphemes.png" alt="morphemes">
						<aside class = "notes">
							It involves dividing words into individual units called morphemes.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>POS-tags</h3>
						<div class="fragment">
							<p> “In our last meeting" - noun  </p>
							<p> "We are meeting again tomorrow” - verb </p>
						</div>
						<aside class = "notes">
							<p> POS-tags or Part-of-speech tagging. It’s identifying the part of speech for every word. </p>
							<p> Here we can find a problem. The word can have more than one part of speech. It depends on the context. That’s why we should use the semantic techniques too. </p>
						</aside>
					</section>

						<h3>semantic techniques</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Named entity recognition (NER)</h3>
						<div>
							<p class="bold"> Examples of groups: persons, locations, organizations, medical codes, etc.</p>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It’s the process of determining the parts of a text that can be categorized into certain groups.</p>
							<p> Ex of groups are: persons, locations, organizations, medical codes, etc. </p>
							<p> As you can see, this technique is related with information extraction application of NLP. </p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> Word sense disambiguation </h3>
						<div class = "fragment">
							<p>Is Washington a man or a state?</p>
							<img src="./assets/imgs/Washington.png" alt="Washington">
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> It involves giving meaning to a word based on the context. </p>
							<p> Is Washington a man or a state? Or maybe a city on the other side of the continent? </p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Chunking</h3>
						<p class="fragment"> <span class="bold"> "South Africa" </span> > "South" + "Africa" </p>
						<aside class="notes">
								<p> There is the same term in cognitive psychology and (surprisingly) it means the same. </p>
								<p> It’s a process of taking individual () pieces of information and grouping them into bigger. </p>
								<p> It’s better to use the phrase “South Africa” as a single word instead of two separate words - ‘South’ and ‘Africa’. </p>

						<h3>Problems</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Diversity</li>
							<li class="fragment">Productivity</li>
							<li class="fragment">Ambiguity</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Many different styles of language. MOREOVER -  more than 7000 different languages exist.</p>
							<p>Language is productive. It means that new words appear all the time.</p>
							<p>Ambiguity at all levels. We can handle it with the help of Probability.</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 class="fragment">Language is hard.</h2>
						<h2 class="fragment">Language is interesting.</h2>
						<h2 class="fragment">NLP is interdisciplinary.</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>People from different professions make treasure in its development.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>mathematics/machine learning/CS theory</li>
								<li>cognitive science</li>
								<li>engineering</li>
								<li>linguistics</li>
